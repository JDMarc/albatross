Albatross Pi HUD Prototype
==========================

This repository contains a Pygame-based head-up display prototype for The Albatross
motorcycle project. The demo emulates the look and feel of the retro-styled HUD
outlined in ``docs/albatross_pi_spec.md`` and provides a development scaffold for
future integration with the real CAN data sources.

Running the demo
----------------

The HUD demo renders a simulated cockpit using synthetic telemetry generated by
``StateSimulator``. Ensure Pygame is installed (``pip install pygame``) and then run:

```
python main.py --width 1280 --height 480
```

Use ``Ctrl+C`` in the terminal or close the HUD window to exit. The demo will
animate RPM, boost, temperatures, traction indicators, Air Shot status, and the
Guardian Light mood to provide a representative dashboard layout for iteration.
